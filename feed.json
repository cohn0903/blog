				"content_text": "Been radio silent most of the week as I've been trying to balance interviewing, applying for jobs and trying to be present for my kids who are home from school because of Houston's \"once in a generation\" snowstorm!\n\nThe job search _seems_ to be going well. Talking with a few different companies, which feels good considering the absolute horror stories out there of people looking for jobs for months and months, even years. So, fingers crossed! \n\nCertainly not an original thought but the job market is insane at the moment. Relatively reputable job boards like LinkedIn will have 100+ applications submitted for jobs in hours. Lots of sharks are out there too, taking advantage of people who just want to work. \n\nI did something that I've never done before after being let go from my previous company, I made one of those \"I lost my job, can you help\" [posts](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ericjcohn_opentowork-saas-accountmanagement-activity-7282152620180324352-q3EV?utm_source=social_share_sheet&utm_medium=member_desktop_web) on LinkedIn. \n\nWhile I'm certainly not helping the cliche, I'm generally not very good at asking for help. Really quickly though, I saw the hiring environment I'm now a part of and realized that I needed to ask for help and I needed to get over myself.\n\nI've been really blown away by the response and help I've received from friends, former colleagues and even a few strangers! It's really made my heart full in a way that chokes me up when I think about it.\n\nSoooo....new job, soon?ü§û\n",
