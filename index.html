		<a href="https://co-hn.com/2025/06/03/ham-radio.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-06-03 15:31:31 -0500">Jun 3, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>During the worst of COVID, I spent time getting random certifications in an effort to kill time by learning new skills.</p>
<p>Being in Houston shortly after Hurricane Harvey, I decided to get a ham radio license in case I ever need to connect with someone and the phone networks go down - as they seem to be doing a lot lately.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not something I do often but every once in a while I‚Äôll check on the local repeaters. Who is using the ham spectrum in the year 2025? Short answer: Seniors, almost exclusively seniors. Are there young hams? Sure. Have I ever encountered one? No, I have not.</p>
<p>What are they talking about? Basically only three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ham Radio</li>
<li>Weather</li>
<li>Politics</li>
</ol>
<p>The third one is, no surprise, the one that seems to come up the most.</p>
<p>When you‚Äôre studying for your ham license, you learn all the ways that it is illegal to use the airwaves. The spectrum is set aside ‚Äúfor the public good‚Äù and anyone with a license can use it but you can‚Äôt sell things (with a surprising exception made for ham radios and associated parts), play copyrighted content, be obscene or be political.</p>
<p>So ham radio in 2025 (at least where I am able to receive/broadcast, which, to be fair, is in Texas) is a lot of senior citizen edgelords pushing right up to the legal limit of protected speech on the public airwaves or as a guy I heard broadcasting one day call it: Making the Airwaves Great Again üòë</p>
<p>Would I suggest using ham radio today in a non-emergency way? No, I would not.</p>

<p>Number of total jobs applied to: <strong>322</strong>
Total days unemployed: <strong>100</strong> (üò≤)
Presentations created and presented: <strong>4</strong>
Total number of individual interviews: <strong>49</strong>

<strong>12</strong> 2nd round interviews
<strong>6</strong> 3rd round interviews
<strong>4</strong> 4th round interviews
<strong>2</strong> 5th round interviews
<strong>2</strong> 6th round interviews
<strong>1</strong> 7th round interviews
<strong>2 offers</strong></p>
<p>Tell your friends and family to hold on to your jobs tightly right now. Things only look to be getting worse IMO.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Lately, every scroll through my phone or click on a news app feels like plunging into a tidal wave of despair. The headlines these days are relentless: escalating geopolitical tensions, devastating climate catastrophes, economic uncertainties, and humanitarian crises‚Äîall unfolding simultaneously around the globe. Not to mention the schlemiel and schlimazel &ldquo;running&rdquo; the country. As someone who prides themselves on staying informed, I‚Äôve found it increasingly difficult to turn away, even when the barrage of negative news leaves me feeling overwhelmed and anxious. Social media amplifies these crises, presenting a never-ending stream of graphic images and impassioned commentary.</p>
<p>I know staying informed shouldn‚Äôt come at the cost of my well-being and mental health. Instead of constantly being tethered to the news, I&rsquo;m trying to set boundaries.</p>
<p>In addition to slowing my consumption, I‚Äôve started practicing mindfulness to regain control when the news feels too heavy. When the day&rsquo;s headlines threaten to engulf me, I <em>try</em> to take a few minutes to breathe, step back from my screen, and remind myself that while the events unfolding are significant, I can&rsquo;t do anything to support those who need it most right now if I am not also looking out for myself. These moments of intentional disconnect allow me to process my emotions without being submerged by them.</p>
<p>My journey toward balancing the need to stay informed with the necessity of self-care is ongoing. There are days when I still feel pulled back into the vortex of breaking news and Threads and BlueSky still occasionally feel like the constant doom-scrolling I did at &ldquo;the other place.&rdquo; But I understand that caring for myself isn‚Äôt selfish‚Äîit‚Äôs essential, especially when the world seems to be in on fire.</p>
<p>For anyone caught in this whirlwind of modern news, remember that it‚Äôs okay to set limits. We owe it to ourselves to remain empathetic and aware, but also to preserve our mental and emotional well-being. Finding a balance between staying informed and caring for our inner peace isn‚Äôt just a personal triumph‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessary act of self-preservation.</p>

			 <p>Been radio silent most of the week as I&rsquo;ve been trying to balance interviewing, applying for jobs and trying to be present for my kids who are home from school because of Houston&rsquo;s &ldquo;once in a generation&rdquo; snowstorm!</p>
<p>The job search <em>seems</em> to be going well. Talking with a few different companies, which feels good considering the absolute horror stories out there of people looking for jobs for months and months, even years. So, fingers crossed!</p>
<p>Certainly not an original thought but the job market is insane at the moment. Relatively reputable job boards like LinkedIn will have 100+ applications submitted for jobs in hours. Lots of sharks are out there too, taking advantage of people who just want to work.</p>
<p>I did something that I&rsquo;ve never done before after being let go from my previous company, I made one of those &ldquo;I lost my job, can you help&rdquo; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ericjcohn_opentowork-saas-accountmanagement-activity-7282152620180324352-q3EV?utm_source=social_share_sheet&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web">posts</a> on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m certainly not helping the cliche, I&rsquo;m generally not very good at asking for help. Really quickly though, I saw the hiring environment I&rsquo;m now a part of and realized that I needed to ask for help and I needed to get over myself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really blown away by the response and help I&rsquo;ve received from friends, former colleagues and even a few strangers! It&rsquo;s really made my heart full in a way that chokes me up when I think about it.</p>
<p>Soooo&hellip;.new job, soon?ü§û</p>

			 <p><strong>Happy Thursday Everyone!</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now been almost two weeks since my <a href="https://cohntemplations.micro.blog/2025/01/03/first-post-thanks-to-jthingelstad.html">first post</a> on micro.blog and it seems like a perfect time to introduce myself to the community.</p>
<p>My name is Eric Cohn and I live in Houston, Texas. I&rsquo;ve been a life-long tech-obsessive and low-key nerd and have worked at tech companies for most of my professional life. Was laid off a week and a half ago during a &ldquo;RiF&rdquo; at a company that I <em>just</em> joined so my professional commitments have reduced by close to 100%, it&rsquo;s a perfect time to get to know a new platform! <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericjcohn/">Hire me</a>! <strong>Fun fact</strong>: I made a series of vent-y posts after being let go that I figured was ok due to its fairly small reach. Forgot that I had just played around with micro.blog&rsquo;s cross-posting functionality. My threads, LinkedIn and Bluesky do have a modest reach though that I had unintentionally aired my gripes to as well. Check your cross-posting settings kids!ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been circling around micro.blog for a little while after I heard it about in <a href="https://micro.blog/jthingelstad">@jthingelstad</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://weekly.thingelstad.com/">Weekly Thing</a>. He was so kind as to run a holiday micro.blog &ldquo;giveaway&rdquo; for a few of his readers and I was thrilled to have won one of the spots.</p>
<p>My initial reaction to micro.blog was &ldquo;What is this supposed to be?&rdquo; Is it a Twitter replacement? Is it a long-form blog platform? The answer I&rsquo;ve come to so far is: Yes. It can be both of those things and more and it is what you want it to be. I found <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/what-s-the-difference-between-micro-blog-and-twitter/21">this page</a> and <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/12-days-of-microblogging/23">this page</a> really helpful in understanding what is possible here. I&rsquo;m excited to see where things go with my <a href="https://cohntemplations.micro.blog/">admittedly corny-named page</a>. I&rsquo;m sure a personal domain is in my near future. Maybe a rebrand?</p>
<p>What can you expect here? I&rsquo;m guessing stuff about <a href="https://cohntemplations.micro.blog/2025/01/04/finally-had-a-chance-to.html">Houston</a>, <a href="https://cohntemplations.micro.blog/2025/01/05/dad-take-a-picture-of.html">my kids</a>, <a href="https://cohntemplations.micro.blog/2025/01/10/the-future-is-now.html">tech stuff</a> and dad jokes, definitely dad jokes. I&rsquo;ve also posted a <a href="https://cohntemplations.micro.blog/blogroll/">blogroll</a> of some of the sites I follow day to day.</p>
<p>Excited to be here and be a part of the community. Drop me a line!</p>
